# Task 1 - Algorithm of the Robot Walking Motion

## Write a Servo Motor Operation Algorithm for Robot Walking Motion
### A Step by Step Guide: 

### - Define the Walking Type of the Robot
The type of walking the robot will use is Bipedal walking, which is For two-legged robots, and it typically involves a cycle of lifting, swinging, and placing each leg.

### - Identify the Number and Position of the Servo Motors
We need to determine the initial and target positions for each servo motor and the number of servos involved in the walking motion. For a simple bipedal robot, it will need 6 servo motors, this might include 2 servos in the hips, 2 in the knees, and 2 in the ankles.

## Tinkercad

### - Gather Components:
Get 6 Servo Motors, an Arduino Uno, a Breadboard, and 6 Potentiometers.

### - Potentiometers:
1.	Drop 6 potentiometers onto the breadboard.
2.	Connect one side pin of each potentiometer to the ground rail on the breadboard.
3.	Connect the other side pin of each potentiometer to the power rail on the breadboard.
4.	Connect the middle pin of each potentiometer to separate pins on the Arduino (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5).
### - Servo Motors:
1.	Drop 6 servo motors in the workspace.
2.	Connect the signal wire of each servo to separate PWM pins on the Arduino.
3.	Connect the power wire of each servo to the power rail on the breadboard.
4. Connect the ground wire of each servo to the ground rail on the breadboard.
### - Connect the Arduino Uno and the Breadboard:
1.	Connect the 5V pin on the Arduino to the power rail on the breadboard.
2.	Connect the GND pin on the Arduino to the ground rail on the breadboard.
### - Write the Code that controls the motion of the servo motors on Arduino IDE using C++ and paste it in the Code section of Tinkercad (or directly write it in the Code section on Tinkercad)

### - Test for Accuracy:
Regularly testing and refining the algorithm based on the observations made on the motion of the servos, and the execution of the code will help identify and correct any issues with either the code or the servos, ensuring the robot walks effectively.
