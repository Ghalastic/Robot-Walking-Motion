# Task 1 - Robot Walking Motion

## Write a Servo Motor Operation Algorithm for Robot Walking Motion
### Step-by-Step Guide: - 

## - Gather Components:
Get 6 Servo Motors, an Arduino Uno, a Breadboard, and 6 Potentiometers.

## - Place and Connect the Potentiometers:
1.	Drop 6 potentiometers onto the breadboard.
2.	Connect one side pin of each potentiometer to the ground rail on the breadboard.
3.	Connect the other side pin of each potentiometer to the power rail on the breadboard.
4.	Connect the middle pin of each potentiometer to separate pins on the Arduino (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5).

## - Place and Connect the Servo Motors:
1.	Drop 6 servo motors in the workspace.
2.	Connect the signal wire of each servo to separate PWM pins on the Arduino.
3.	Connect the power wire of each servo to the power rail on the breadboard.
4. Connect the ground wire of each servo to the ground rail on the breadboard.

## - Arduino Uno and Breadboard Connections:
1.	Connect the 5V pin on the Arduino to the power rail on the breadboard.
2.	Connect the GND pin on the Arduino to the ground rail on the breadboard.
## - Write the Code on Arduino IDE (or on the Code section of Tinkercad)
